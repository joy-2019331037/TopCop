unfortunately a lot has changed since my hdd was destroyed

Previous hdd had the xampp folder which had a data folder which contained the data of the localhost phpmyadmin database (named crime record) required for this app. So, in order to run this app again everything related to the database should be developed again from scratch, which is you-konw-what time consuming. If in anyway that xampp folder could be retrieved from the hdd, that would save a lot of time otherwise it needs to be done from the starting again.
Rest of the files containing features and designs I suppose are as they were.

Opening this Crime_record_management folder with netbeans might still throw some errors, which would basically say that some jar and xml filepaths are missing. These can also be fixed easily. All the required jar files are in the /dist/lib/ folder. Adding these jars in the libraries section of netbeans would solve the issue.

I am pushing all these to github today, but the database issue is still there. It needs to be build again.
